## üîç Overview

Auth App is a comprehensive authentication and authorization microservice built with Spring Boot. It provides a secure,
scalable, and flexible solution for managing user identities, authentication, and access control in distributed systems.
The service is designed to be integrated with other microservices in the ecosystem, providing centralized authentication
and authorization capabilities.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Auth App follows a layered architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

### Layers

1. **API Layer (Controllers)**: Handles HTTP requests and responses
2. **Service Layer**: Contains business logic and orchestrates operations
3. **Repository Layer**: Manages data access and persistence
4. **Security Layer**: Implements authentication and authorization mechanisms

### Key Components

- **JWT Authentication**: Stateless authentication using JSON Web Tokens
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Fine-grained access control based on user roles and permissions
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks and DoS
- **Auditing**: Comprehensive tracking of data changes and user actions

### Integration Points

- **Redis**: For caching and rate limiting
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- **OTP Service**: For two-factor authentication

## üöÄ Features

- **Username/Password Authentication**
    - Secure login using email/username and password
    - Password hashing with industry best practices
    - Role-based access control (RBAC) for user privileges

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
    - Fine-grained access based on user roles and permissions
    - Custom role definitions for flexibility
    - Permission-based authorization for API endpoints

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) / OTP Service (Mobile/Email)**
    - Additional security via OTP or app-based authenticators (TOTP)
    - Optional enforcement for critical actions
    - One-time password (OTP) generation and validation
    - SMS and email OTP delivery support
    - [otp-service-implementation](https://github.com/immortals-ume/otp-service)

- **Remember Me**
    - Persistent login functionality
    - Secure storage and expiration control for authentication tokens

- **Refresh Token**
    - Secure refresh token mechanism for session extension
    - Token expiration and revocation support

- **Anonymous Authentication**
    - Guest/anonymous user support with limited access
    - Seamless upgrade from guest to registered user without losing session

- **Logout**
    - Secure logout with token invalidation
    - Global logout for all active sessions

- **Security Measures**
    - JWT-based authentication
    - Secure HTTPS communication
    - Rate limiting and brute force protection
    - IP-based and username-based rate limiting

- **User Management**
    - User registration and profile management
    - Password reset and account recovery
    - Email and phone verification

## üìö API Documentation

The Auth App provides comprehensive API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger.

### Accessing API Documentation

- **Swagger UI**: Available at `/swagger-ui.html` when the application is running
- **OpenAPI Specification**: Available at `/v3/api-docs`

### API Endpoints

The API is organized into the following categories:

1. **Authentication API**
    - Login, logout, token refresh
    - Guest authentication
    - Password management

2. **User Management API**
    - User registration and profile management
    - Role and permission management

3. **Location API**
    - Country, state, and city management
    - User address management

For detailed API documentation, refer to the OpenAPI specifications:

- [Authentication API Specification](/specs/auth-api.yaml)
- [Location API Specification](/specs/users-location-api.yaml)

## üìä Data Models

### Core Entities

1. **User**
    - Basic user information (username, email, name)
    - Authentication details (password, account status)
    - Contact information (phone, email)
    - Relationships with roles and addresses

2. **UserAddress**
    - Address information (street, city, state, country)
    - Address type and status
    - Geolocation data (latitude, longitude)

3. **Roles**
    - Role name and description
    - Associated permissions
    - Active status

4. **Permissions**
    - Permission name
    - Active status

### Entity Relationships

- **User to Roles**: Many-to-Many (a user can have multiple roles, a role can be assigned to multiple users)
- **Roles to Permissions**: Many-to-Many (a role can have multiple permissions, a permission can be part of multiple
  roles)
- **User to UserAddress**: One-to-Many (a user can have multiple addresses)
- **UserAddress to Location Entities**: Many-to-One (an address belongs to one city, state, and country)

## üîí Security Best Practices

- **Authentication**: JWT-based with proper signature validation and expiration
- **Password Storage**: BCrypt hashing with appropriate work factor
- **Communication**: All API endpoints require HTTPS
- **Rate Limiting**: IP-based and username-based rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all user inputs
